## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- After the PC wakes from sleep, the fan profile comes back. The service now hears sleep and wake, holds fan writes for 5 seconds after the wake while the firmware lets go of the fan controller, then applies the profile again. Before, a write during the wake could trip the safety handback, which kept the fans on BIOS until you applied a profile by hand. A failed duty check now logs every reading and the mode bit. (#29)
- In the layout editor, the part under the pointer is the one that moves: parts inside the case, offline parts and parts near its edge no longer drag the whole case, and moving the case carries everything inside it. Alt-click picks the part underneath. (#3)
- Uninstalling with an unreadable SignalRGB restore record says so, keeps the record, finishes the other steps (in the Inno uninstaller too) and prints the service name and command to restore SignalRGB by hand, instead of skipping the restore and saying it finished. (#24)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-10-29

### Fixed

- Toasts in the editor go away after a few seconds again instead of staying on screen. (#12)

## [0.1.2] - 2026-10-29

### Fixed

- Displays shows the ZEUS CAST notice only while ZEUS CAST is running, and the display reads "waiting for ZEUS CAST" then. (#14)
- The boot colour waits until OpenRGB has found your devices, so it lands on them instead of on nothing. Devices OpenRGB announces within 15 s of the first write get the colour too; the log says how many were still unpainted when that window closed. (#18)
- The daemon writes why it stopped to its log: a quit, closing its window, logoff, shutdown, a panic, or a port that is taken. The service logs every time it ends the daemon and names exit codes such as `0xC0000142 STATUS_DLL_INIT_FAILED`. (#19)

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-29

### Added

- canvas-rgb checks for a newer release once a day and installs it when you click Update now. (#21)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-29

The first release.

### Added

- One layout for every device: an effect paints across the whole case as a single picture.
- Fourteen built-in effects, and SignalRGB-format HTML effects loaded from
  `%APPDATA%\canvas-rgb\effects\` or imported with `canvas-rgb effects import`.
- Lighting through OpenRGB and native adapters (the ROYUAN MonsGeek keyboard).
- Fan control on the NCT6687D chip through PawnIO: curves, fixed speeds or BIOS control per header,
  saved as named profiles, with BIOS taking every fan back on a shutdown, a panic or a lost sensor.
- The GAMDIAS CHIONE pump display, showing a temperature or a fan speed.
- Settings for the Attack Shark X6 mouse and the 8BitDo Ultimate 2 controller.
- The editor, the tray app, the `canvas-rgb` CLI and the Windows installer.
