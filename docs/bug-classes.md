# Bug classes

A bug class is a kind of mistake that can happen in more than one place. This file lists the classes
canvas-rgb has hit, the issues in each, and what closes the class for good. Read it before you work in
an area that is new to you.

Each class matches a `cause:` label on GitHub. The `area:` labels say where a bug showed up; the
`cause:` label says why.

## How a fix works

1. **Fix the bug and add a regression test** that runs on the fakes. The commit names the issue:
   `Fixes #N`.
2. **Search for siblings.** Before you close the issue, look for every other place the same mistake
   can happen. Fix each one, or file it with the same `cause:` label.
3. **On the second bug of a class, close the class.** One bug is a mistake. Two of the same kind,
   in different areas, mean the code makes the mistake easy. Make it impossible instead: a shared
   helper that every caller goes through, a type in `canvas-proto` that fails to compile, a check in
   CI, or one test that runs over every area. Then add or update the class here.

## Classes

### `cause:ui-interaction`: hit-testing that skips elements

The editor asks "what is under the pointer?" with `document.elementsFromPoint`. That call skips
elements with `pointer-events: none`, so a press on such an element lands on whatever sits behind it.

- [#3](https://github.com/iAmChumby/canvas-rgb/issues/3): grabbing a part inside the case drags the
  whole case. Offline zones have `pointer-events: none` (`app/web/src/views/desk.module.css`), so the
  case's `partUnder()` guard in `PreviewStage.tsx` finds no part and starts a case move.
- **Class fix:** none yet. Where to look for siblings: every nested draggable in the editor (parts in
  the case, fan curve points, the desk).

### `cause:platform-api`: a Windows API called the wrong way

The call compiles and returns an error code, or no data, at run time. The fakes do not exercise these
APIs, so the tests pass.

- [#1](https://github.com/iAmChumby/canvas-rgb/issues/1): Audio Spectrum and Screen Ambience turned
  every light off. The WASAPI loopback client got an 18-byte copy of the mix format, which dropped the
  `WAVEFORMATEXTENSIBLE` extension (`crates/canvas-daemon/src/capture/audio.rs`). `D3D11CreateDevice`
  used the wrong driver type with an adapter (`crates/canvas-daemon/src/capture/screen.rs`). Both are
  fixed in 0.1.0; the issue stays open until they are confirmed on real lights.
- **Class fix:** none yet. Each capture path logs a WARN when it fails to start
  (`crates/canvas-daemon/src/capture/mod.rs`), but a capture that starts and then gets no data stays
  silent.
